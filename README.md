## Hello! I am Instellate
I am a C# Developer that sometimes does JavaScript and TypeScript.  
I develop mainly discord bots for now but I am extending out to APIs. Currently working on a discord library called [Interacord](https://github.com/Instellate/Interacord), Slash commands for [Anti NSFW](https://top.gg/bot/706054368318980138) and a image board that isn't released *yet*.

### Fun Facts!
```
Status - student.
Living - Stockholm, Sweden.
Languages (Talking) - Fluent in Swedish and (maybe) English.
Languages (Programming) - C#, C++ (still learning) and JS/TS.
Interests - Vocaloid, Anime, VTubers and programming (of course!)
```

### Want to get in contact?
You can email me at instellate@gmail.com.  
I will probably not answer as I don't check that email too much.

My discord username is also [Instellate#3622](https://discord.com/users/565197576026980365).  
So if you see me anywhere. Feel free to say hello!
